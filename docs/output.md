# nf-core/stableexpression: Output

## Introduction

This document describes the output produced by the pipeline.

## Pipeline overview

The pipeline is built using [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) and processes data using the following steps:

- [Expression Atlas](#expression-atlas)
- [DESeq2](#deseq2) or [EdgeR](#edger): normalise raw data
- [g:Profiler](#gprofiler-idmapping): map gene IDS to Ensembl IDS
- [Variation coefficient](#variation-coefficient): Compute gene variation coefficients and get the most stable genes

### Expression Atlas

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `expressionatlas/`
  - List of accessions found when querying Expression Atlas: `accessions.txt`.
  - A list of count datasets and experimental designs download from Expression Atlas. Normalized datasets have the `normalised.csv` while not normalised datasets have the `raw.csv` extension.

</details>

### Deseq2

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `normalisation/deseq2/`
  - List of newly normalised datasets

</details>

### EdgeR

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `normalisation/edger/`
  - List of newly normalised datasets

</details>

### GProfiler IDMapping

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `idmapping/`
  - Count datasets whose gene IDs have been mapped to Ensembl IDs (suffix `renamed.csv`).
  - Correspondencies between original gene IDs and Ensembl IDs (suffix `mapping.json`.)

</details>

### Variation coefficient

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `variation_coefficients/`
  - An ordered list from the most stable (first line) to the least stable gene in `variation_coefficients.csv`.
  - All normalised counts (for each gene and each sample) in `all_normalised_counts.csv`.

</details>

### Pipeline information

<details markdown="1">
<summary>Output files</summary>

- `pipeline_info/`
  - Reports generated by Nextflow: `execution_report.html`, `execution_timeline.html`, `execution_trace.txt` and `pipeline_dag.dot`/`pipeline_dag.svg`.
  - Reports generated by the pipeline: `pipeline_report.html`, `pipeline_report.txt` and `software_versions.yml`. The `pipeline_report*` files will only be present if the `--email` / `--email_on_fail` parameter's are used when running the pipeline.
  - Parameters used by the pipeline run: `params.json`.

[Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/tracing.html) provides excellent functionality for generating various reports relevant to the running and execution of the pipeline. This will allow you to troubleshoot errors with the running of the pipeline, and also provide you with other information such as launch commands, run times and resource usage.
